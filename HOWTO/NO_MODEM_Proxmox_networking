How to connect to another computers shared wifi internet connection via ethernet thru router with no modem needed, then to PROXMOX server and clients



I have no modem to get a WAN ethernet connection thru because i live in an RV park, and wifi doesnt work well in PROXMOX if you can even get it working at all

Plugged the ethernet cable from my laptop (LP) into the WAN port of the router

On the LP I am dual booting PROXMOX and Linux Mint. while running Mint I connected to the RV park wifi

Setup up the ethernet connection of the LP using automatic (DHCP)

Created another ethernet connection in the network manager GUI and "shared the connection with other computers" and 

Set the static IP (ex. 192.168.1.210) and default gateway (ex. 192.168.1.1) making sure to set it to a differnet subnet as my router which is 192.168.0.1

also setting the routers DHCP server to disabled and set internet connection type to dynamic IP if needed, most will do it automaticly 

Mint shows connected to both the shared ethernet connection and wifi at the same time and router shows good lights that its connected as well 

No changes have to be made to PROXMOX server network settings or client settings, works same as when there is a modem
