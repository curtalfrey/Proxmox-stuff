# ssh Harden a VM on proxmox


# once the key is copied from the host to the client then edit the sshd_config file to prevent root login and all passwords
# ben@ip address:~$ sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# remove the # sign in front of Port and change port from 22 to some random high number like 716
# remove the # sign in front of the word AddessFamily and change any to inet
# remove the # sign in front of PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
# remove the # sign in front of PasswordAuthentication and change to no
# remove the # sign in front of PermitEmptyPasswords and change to no



#  !!! DONT LOGOUT !!! 



# open a new terminal and try to ssh into the client, it should fail

# now try to ssh into it adding -p (and the new port number you put in the sshd_config file) 
# ben@ip address -p 716

# check open ports
# sudo ss -tupln

# Add the port 716 to the firewall so you can only ssh into that port
# sudo ufw allow 716
# sudo ufw status 
# you should see that port allowed


#  !!! DONT LOGOUT !!!



# now try to ssh into it adding -p (and the new port number you put in the sshd_config file) 
# ben@ip address -p 716

# add (allow) any and all ports you need open  (any ports not added with the allow command will be blocked once ufw is enabled) 

# enable ufw
# sudo ufw enable



# now block pings
# sudo nano /etc/ufw/before.rules
# scroll down to this section ---->    # ok icmp codes for INPUT
# add this line to the top line ---->   -A ufw-before-input -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j DROP


# reboot for changes to take affect
# sudo reboot
