# System-wide Directory: You can place the file in a directory that is accessible to all users. A common location for such files is /usr/local/share, but it might vary based on your distribution.
sudo cp /path/to/your/file /usr/local/share/

# Permissions: Make sure the file is accessible to all users by adjusting its permissions:
sudo chmod a+rwx /usr/local/share/yourfile

# Create a Desktop Shortcut: To make it easily accessible on the desktop, you can create a .desktop file in the system-wide applications directory. For example, you can create a .desktop file in /usr/share/applications
sudo nano /usr/share/applications/yourfile.desktop

# Inside the .desktop file, you should have something like this:

[Desktop Entry]
Name=Your File Name
Exec=/usr/local/share/yourfile
Type=Application
Terminal=false
Icon=/path/to/icon (if you have one)
Categories=Utility;

# Update the Desktop Database: In Debian, you should update the desktop database to ensure that the new entry is recognized:
sudo update-desktop-database
