#Type the following command to list all available drives:
sudo fdisk -l

#example /dev/sdb1

#Create a mount point directory. This is the directory where the thumb drive will be mounted. For example:
sudo mkdir /mnt/usb

#Mount the thumb drive to the mount point directory using the following command:
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb

#Once the thumb drive is mounted, you can access it by navigating to the mount point directory:
cd /mnt/usb

#When you are finished using the thumb drive, unmount it using the following command:
umount /mnt/usb
