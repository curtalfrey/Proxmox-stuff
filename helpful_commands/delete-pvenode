Move all virtual machines out of the node, just use the Central Web-based Management 2.0 to migrate or delete all VMÂ´s. Make sure you have no local backups you want to keep, or save them accordingly.
Log in to one remaining node via ssh. Issue a pvecm nodes command to identify the nodeID:



pvecm nodes




Membership information
----------------------
    Nodeid      Votes Name
         1          1 pve
         2          1 pve1 (local)
         3          1 pve2


Issue the delete command (here deleting node hp2):



!!! make sure the node is turned off!!!

pvecm delnode pve1



If the operation succeeds no output is returned, just check the node list again with 'pvecm nodes' (or just 'pvecm n').

delete other nodes if wanted

to delete the cluster run these commands from the manager node

sudo stop pve-cluster
sudo stop corosync
sudo pmxcfs -l
sudo rm /etc/pve/corosync.conf
sudo rm -r /etc/corosync/*
sudo killall pmxcfs
sudo systemctl start pve-cluster


sudo pvecm nodes

you should see this error
Error: Corosync config '/etc/pve/corosync.conf' does not exist - is this node part of a cluster?
reboot and create another cluster in GUI if wanted
