Install k0s as a service

The k0s install sub-command installs k0s as a system service on the local host that is running one of the supported init systems: Systemd or OpenRC. You can execute the install for workers, controllers or single node (controller+worker) instances.


Run the following command to install a single node k0s that includes the controller and worker functions with the default configuration:


sudo k0s install controller --single



The k0s install controller sub-command accepts the same flags and parameters as the k0s controller. Refer to manual install for a custom config file example.

It is possible to set environment variables with the install command:

sudo k0s install controller -e ETCD_UNSUPPORTED_ARCH=arm
The system service can be reinstalled with the --force flag:

sudo k0s install controller --single --force
sudo systemctl daemon-reload




Start k0s as a service

To start the k0s service, run:

sudo k0s start




The k0s service will start automatically after the node restart.

A minute or two typically passes before the node is ready to deploy applications.

Check service, logs and k0s status





To get general information about your k0s instance's status, run:

$ sudo k0s status
Version: v1.27.5+k0s.0
Process ID: 436
Role: controller
Workloads: true
Init System: linux-systemd
Access your cluster using kubectl




Note: k0s includes the Kubernetes command-line tool kubectl.

Use kubectl to deploy your application or to check your node status:




$ sudo k0s kubectl get nodes
NAME   STATUS   ROLES    AGE    VERSION
k0s    Ready    <none>   4m6s   v1.27.5+k0s
