To create a 32GB partition starting at sector 73402368, you need to determine the number of sectors that corresponds to 32GB.

One gigabyte (GB) is equal to 1,073,741,824 bytes, and each sector typically contains 512 bytes. Therefore, one GB is equal to approximately 2,097,152 sectors (1,073,741,824 รท 512).

To calculate the number of sectors needed for a 32GB partition, you can multiply 32GB by 2,097,152 sectors per GB:

32 GB ร 2,097,152 sectors/GB = 67,108,864 sectors

So, to create a 32GB partition starting at sector 73402368, you would need to partition 67,108,864 sectors starting at sector 73402368.


example


To add 32GB to the first sector of an SSD, you need to first convert 32GB to the number of sectors that make up 32GB. The sector size of an SSD can vary, but a common size is 512 bytes per sector. Therefore, 32GB would be equal to:

32GB = 32 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024 bytes
= 34,359,738,368 bytes
= 67,108,864 sectors

To get the new sector number, you simply need to add the number of new sectors (67,108,864) to the original sector number (73,400,321):

73,400,321 + 67,108,864 = 140,509,185

Therefore, the new sector number after adding 32GB to the first sector of the SSD is 140,509,185.
