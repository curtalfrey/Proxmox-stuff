To create a 32GB partition starting at sector 73402368, you need to determine the number of sectors that corresponds to 32GB.

One gigabyte (GB) is equal to 1,073,741,824 bytes, and each sector typically contains 512 bytes. Therefore, one GB is equal to approximately 2,097,152 sectors (1,073,741,824 รท 512).

To calculate the number of sectors needed for a 32GB partition, you can multiply 32GB by 2,097,152 sectors per GB:

32 GB ร 2,097,152 sectors/GB = 67,108,864 sectors

So, to create a 32GB partition starting at sector 73402368, you would need to partition 67,108,864 sectors starting at sector 73402368.
